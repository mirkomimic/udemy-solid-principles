1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
"A class should have only one reason to change"

- Responsibility is the reason for change

2. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
"If a program is using a base class, then the reference to the base class
can be replaced or should be replaceable with a derived class or sub class
without affecting the functionality of the program"

- return type of methods can't change -- Covariance
- parameters of the method can't change - Contravariance
- The exception thrown in sub class should either be the same as parent class
or more specialized

a. Covariance
--------------
Method return type should be covariant i.e. return should be the same or narrower
Postconditions cannot be weakened in a subtype

b. Contravariance
-----------------
Method arguments or input parameters should be the same or widened.
Preconditions cannot be strengthened in a subtype

c. No new Exceptions
-----------------------
No new ixceptions hould be thrown by methods of the subtype, except where those exceptions are themselves subtypes of exceptions thrown by the methods of the supertype
